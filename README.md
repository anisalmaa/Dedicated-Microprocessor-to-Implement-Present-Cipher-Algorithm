The aim of this project is to successfully design and program a microprocessor to which can successfully implement both encryption and decryption of the present cipher encryption algorithm on an FPGA using VHDL.

Design Methodology
-Xilinx ISE used for design using VHDL
-The processor consists of a Datapath and Control Unit.

Synthesis and Implementation For FPGA
-Design synthesised correctly for the retired Xilinx Spartan 3 FPGA
-The spartan 3 can be used as reference when deciding an FPGA for synthesis/implementation of this project.
